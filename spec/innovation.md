# Innovation Day Ideas

## Prompting for AI (instructions file)

1. Prompts need to include things that the AI should ALWAYS consider (like security, performance, accessibility, etc)

## MCP Enhancements

1. Need multiple catalogs for different business units
2. Need cross-cutting roles for a project that are outside the catalog - these roles aren't based on features, they are time-based for the duration of the project (like project manager, business analyst, etc)
3. Roles should have seniority levels (like junior, mid-level, senior) that impact the time necessary - like a multiplier based on the level of the resource
